# MY-ANALYSIS-AND-FEATURE-ENGINEERING
Hello, My name is Rohan Bhatt,I completed my Bachelors of technology in Computer Science engineering from NorthCap university  and studied post graduate diploma in datascience and artificial intelligence from Loyalist college in Toronto , Canada. This is my repository  wherein I would love to potray my  deep interest in Data analysis , feature engineering and predictive analysis. I will work upon several datasets and show how our approach should be towards any EDA. Reviews over my repository would be highly appreciated as this will not only help me and you to grow but also this beautifull community of datascience.
